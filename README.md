# Emotion Recognition & Learning Anxiety Detection

**This repository contains an emotion recognition model that detects emotions from images and videos using Detecto (Faster R-CNN). The model predicts emotions and calculates a Learning Anxiety Score based on detected emotions.**

**Features:**
  Detects seven emotions: Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise
  Calculates Learning Anxiety Score based on emotional intensity
  Supports image-based prediction with visualization
  Supports video processing with real-time annotation
  Uses Detecto (Faster R-CNN) for object detection
  Applies data augmentation for better generalization
  Implements pruning and thresholding for improved accuracy
  Saves and loads trained models for inference_
